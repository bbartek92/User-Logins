# User-Logins

The Main.py is the one with the app. In the working.py file you will find the code which I used to fill database and JSON file.

This application covers login feature. If you click login it will take the login and password, hash them and check the database for the match.
In case of match, the login page closes and new black window opens. Add user displays separate window without closing the login one.
